# Data-Analysis of my favourite DataScience and Machine Learning YouTube Channel


### WHY THIS PROJECT?

It all started with the urge of learning Machine Learning and I was unable to understand it in an efficient manner because I didn't have a strong technical background but scrolling down and down on YouTube finding a perfect solutions for my doubts, I found out a channel called CampusX. It was an amaxing channel by an Indian Teacher, The way he taught machine learning was very unique and very intuitive. I later scrolled more in his videos and entered the comment session and saw that there are many comments saying that the teaching is amazing but the Teacher as well his Channel was very very underrated.
So I wanted to do a data analysis for his channel comparing it to other 50 such YouTube channels.
